    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am an Economics PhD student at the Catholic University of Brasília, Brazil. <br>
      I work in the regional economics area at Banco do Brasil, where we study economic analysis methods using applied economics.
    </p>
    <h2>Lines of research</h2>
    <p>Regional Economy and Banking Finance</p>
    <h2>Topics of interest</h2>
    <p>Regional Economics and Development  <br>
      Spatial Econometric  <br>
      Regional Analysis Methods <br>
      Consumer spending<br>
      Economics of Payments <br>
      Card transactions <br>
      Complex Networks  <br>
      Econometrics and Banking
    </p>
    <h2>PhD projects</h2>
    <p> 1 - I examine the consumption profile of individuals in various economic activities at the municipal level, using card transaction
       data and segmenting the data by credit card profile, customer and economic activity. I use the private database, which
        is one of the largest banks in Latin America. Additionally, explore this data using Big Data techniques and programs in R, 
        Python and Spark to effectively deal with complex data sets.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
      2 - A second database that encompasses all payments methods. The main objective is to identify, in real time, the sectors most 
      vulnerable to adverse climate shocks, providing a detailed understanding of how extreme weather events can affect economic dynamics.
       A topological network analysis will be carried out to discover significant patterns and clusters, which facilitates understanding of 
       how payment flows are organized both spatially and sectorally.</p>
